Here are a few React Hooks tasks that you can practice to improve your skills:

1. Counter: Create a simple counter application using the `useState` hook. It should have buttons to increment and decrement the counter value.

2. Todo List: Build a todo list application using the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. Implement functionality to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.

3. Fetching Data: Use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from an API and display it in your component. You can fetch and display a list of posts, products, or any other data you prefer.

4. Form Handling: Create a form with input fields and use the `useState` hook to handle form state. Implement validation and display error messages when necessary.

5. Theme Switcher: Build a theme switcher component using the `useState` hook. Allow users to toggle between light and dark themes, and apply the chosen theme to the entire application.

6. Local Storage: Use the `localStorage` API with the `useState` hook to store and retrieve data. Create a simple application that allows users to add items to a shopping cart and persist the cart data across page refreshes.

7. Mouse Position: Use the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks to track and display the current position of the mouse cursor in your application.

8. Debouncing Input: Implement a search bar component that debounces user input. Use the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks to delay the execution of the search query until the user has finished typing.

9. Modal Dialog: Create a reusable modal component using the `useState` hook. It should have an open/close state and display content passed as props.

10. Context Provider: Use the `createContext` and `useContext` hooks to create a context provider. Implement a simple authentication flow where the user's authentication state is shared across multiple components.

These tasks should give you a good foundation for practicing React Hooks. Remember to consult the React documentation and other learning resources as you work through these tasks to deepen your understanding of hooks and their usage.
